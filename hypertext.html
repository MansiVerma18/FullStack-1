        HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages. Hypertext refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked
        together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext. As its name suggests, IITM is a Markup Language which means you use IITML to simply "mark-up" a text document
        with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it lo display. Originally, HTML was developed with the intent of defining the structure of documents like headings, paragraphs, lists, and so
        forth to facilitate the sharing of scientific information between researchers.
